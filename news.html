		<p><b>Academics: </b>
			<br/>
			I am currently attending <em>California Polytechnic University of California, Pomona</em> a.k.a 
			Cal Poly Pomona. This year marks my 3rd year attending this college. I am currently taking 6 courses 
			all comprised of Math, Physics, and Computer Science courses. 
			</p>
			<b>Hobbies: </b>
			I go to the gym 4-5 times a week and I really enjoy doing it because it gives me energy in the start of my day. 
			I also love playing video games such as CS:GO, Fortnite, etc. 
			I would play tennis more often but I unfortunately can't due to my injuries.

		    <b>Projects: </b>
		    A project that I am currently working on is a board-game which is programmed in Python and the other will be created using the Unity3D game engine. The one that I am currently working on is called <em>Codenames</em> which is being developed by my team and I. It is currently only able to be played through a command-line interface. There is also a web application for this game, but it was postponed due to the amount of work we would have to put into the user-interface. The goal of this project is to use ML and develop some type of efficient natural-language processing for a bot to be able to play and win against a human. 
			</p>
			A project that I will soon be working on will be developed through Unity using C#. I am currently taking courses on Lynda.com to be able to learn the basics of Unity and then 
			create my own game from that point on. I currently have a few ideas on what this game will 
			be comprised of and I am excited to start creating my own game!

		<p><b>Academics: </b>
			<br/>
			I am currently attending <em>California Polytechnic University of California, Pomona</em> a.k.a 
			Cal Poly Pomona. This year marks my 3rd year attending this college. I am currently taking 6 courses 
			all comprised of Math, Physics, and Computer Science courses. 
			<br/>
			<b>Hobbies: </b>
			I go to the gym 4-5 times a week and I really enjoy doing it because it gives me energy in the start of my day. 
			I also love playing video games such as CS:GO, Fortnite, and other old trendy games. 
			I would play tennis more often but I can't due to my injuries... :(

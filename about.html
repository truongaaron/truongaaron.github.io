			I'm currently experimenting with many things from the CS realm to see what I can be truly passionate about.
			My current knowledge of programming languages are comprised of Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MIPS, (very little)
			Python and C#. I have tried doing many things such as Web and Game Development, App Development, but I
			am still trying to add variety to explore and set my goal in the field of computer science. 
			<p></p>
			I also really like going to the gym, mostly training for hypertrophy and for powerlifting. Unfortunately, I
			injured my gluteus medius by sprinting up an incline treadmill due to my impatience. This happened because
			I did not attempt warm up or stretch out before I started sprinting which resulted in a severe tear whils
			t I was in the process of my first few sprints. I really hope to recover so I can get back into powerlifting.

			I'm currently experimenting with many things from the CS realm to see what I can be truly passionate about.
			My current knowledge of programming languages are comprised of Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MIPS, (very little)
			Python and C#. I have tried doing many things such as Web and Game Development, App Development, but I
			am still trying to add variety to explore and set my goal in the field of computer science.

			I'm currently experimenting with many things from the CS realm to see what I am really passionate about in this field. My current knowledge of programming languages are comprised of Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MIPS, (very little) Python and C#. I have tried doing many things such as Web and Game Development, App Development, but I am still trying to add variety and find my true passion in the field of computer science. 
			<p></p>
			I also really like going to the gym, mostly training for hypertrophy (muscle building). Unforunately, I injured my gluteus medius by sprinting up an inclined treadmill which caused a tear in that muscle. I really hope to recover so I can start to get more into powerlifting, something that I probably enjoy the most about the gym.
